This daemon was inspired by
  - Christoph Bartelmus's lircd daemon
    <http:http://www.lirc.org/>,
  - Guus Sliepen's inputlircd daemon
    <http://svn.sliepen.eu.org/inputlirc/trunk/>, and
  - Julien Cristau's Xorg udev patch
    <http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-devel/2009-October/002797.html>.

The software's architecture is straight forward. At the center is monitor, which
monitors a list of file descriptors and calls the file descriptor's handler when
the file descriptor is "ready". Initially, lircd creates an lircd socket and
adds it to monitor's file descriptor list so that it can watch for lircd client
connection requests, and input creates a udev monitor adds it to monitor's file
descriptor list so that it can watch for input event devices. When lircd detects
an lircd client connect request, it connects the client and adds it to its
client list so that it can send lircd messages to the client. When input detects
an input event device that is to be handled by eventlircd, it opens the input
device, creates a corresponding mouse/joystick event device (if needed) and
adds the input device to monitor's file descriptor list so that it can watch for
events. When input detects an event on one of its input devices, it performs the
key mapping and sends the resulting mapped event to either the lircd clients or
the input device's mouse/joystick event device depending on whether the mapped
event is a keyboard or mouse/joystick event.
